Hi

We prepared a script in Perl that can scan large number of sites for SQL vulnerability.

You Should Run It By This Way : 

perl script.pl siteslist.txt

"siteslist.txt" is the file that you put the sites list in it.

Remember that you should put sites with qoutation mark in the end of them.

For Example :

site.com/index.php?id=1'

It's not important that you put sites with http:// or https://,the script automatically set them correct.

Then vulnerable sites will save in "vulns.txt" file.
